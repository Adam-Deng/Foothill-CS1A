Test run #1:
What is your weight in pounds? 196
What is your height in inches? 70.75
Your Body Mess Index is: 27.526976238934186
You are overweight


Test run #2:
What is your weight in pounds? 141
What is your height in inches? 67

You BMI is optimal


Test run #3:
What is your weight in pounds? -130
What is your height in inches? 61
Your weight and height must be both greater than zero
